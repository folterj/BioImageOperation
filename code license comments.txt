Function comments (or just generalise without @param/@return etc):

/**
 * Creates a VLC object.
 *
 * Note that because the object name pointer must remain valid, potentially
 * even after the destruction of the object (through the message queues), this
 * function CANNOT be exported to plugins as is. In this case, the old
 * vlc_object_create() must be used instead.
 *
 * @param p_this an existing VLC object
 * @param i_size byte size of the object structure
 * @param psz_type object type name
 * @return the created object, or NULL.
 */
